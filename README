MMPC - Maemo Music Player Client
================================

 MMPC is a frontend for the Music Player Daemon from
 http://www.musicpd.org/. It is based on 'Gnome Music Player Client'
 0.13.0 (http://sarine.nl/gmpc), and thus should contain most of it's
 features. But MMPC is more than just a port to the Maemo platform with
 hildonization etc.. The player interface got replaced and the new one is
 especially designed for maximum screen usage and - more important -
 specialised to be used as a remote control. To achive that, one important
 thing is that it can be controlled via fingers, without the need to use
 the stylus.


Installation
============

 Usual sequence:

   - ./configure
   - make
   - make install
